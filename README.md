# Sega Saturn test apps

This repository contains a suite of tests that I used to help develop a Sega Saturn emulator.

## Building

The tests require [YAUL](https://www.yaul.org) to build. Follow the installation instructions on [libyaul's README](https://github.com/yaul-org/libyaul), then run `make` on the root of this repository to build all tests.

Run `make list-tests` to list all available test apps.
